## Overview of Analysis

This project utilizes Openweather API to pull weather data for 2000 randomly generated coordinates. Using citipy, the nearest cities to these coordinates were collected. Following this, I used Google Maps API to pull the names of hotels near the selected cities. The end result for the user is the ability to specify the preferred weather for their next vacation and after this they are provided a map of hotels that meet their specifications. Using the Google maps API, I also created an itinerary for a hypethetical trip between four cities in Australia.
